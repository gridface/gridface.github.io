					<h2 class="text-center title">Designing For Desktop and Mobile in 2018</h2>
				<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2 col-lg-8" >    
						
					<h5><strong>Why Am I Still Attached To This Bulky Laptop?<br></strong></h5>
					<p>
							At last check, something like 80% of web traffic is accessed via a mobile device.  At first this number was surprising to me, but I started doing a little inventory of all of the networked activities I do on a daily basis.  As most of my income relies on writing code, it's no surprise that most of the time during the day I am sitting in front of a laptop with a couple of large monitors inspecting lines of colorful computer code and web graphics.  The form factor makes it difficult for me to transfer that design and programming piece to a mobile device, but what about all of my other online activities? 
					</p>
					<p>
							All of my email is moving almost exclusively to mobile access at this point.  My social media is managed exclusively through my phone now.  Like my other writing, I do manage my client proposals through my laptop, but that is only because I don't have a nice bluetooth keyboard (though my wife does).  So this begs the question - if I am not doing programming, graphic design, or writing, what do I really need a laptop for?  More importantly, what do my customers need a laptop for?
					</p>   
					<p>
							I could think of one answer to this question - and it's a big one.  Did you already think of it?
					</p>
					<p>
							That's right. Gaming.	
					</p>
					<p>
							Facebook games have their appeal, as does Pokemon Go, but nothing beats the immersive, high rez experience of an MMO like World of Warcraft or an FPS like Counterstrike.  And while your favorite games might be different from mine, I bet you have a similar experience.  And so do our customers.	
					</p>
					<h5><strong>The Sparse Web<br></strong></h5>
					<p>
							I was at a conference a couple weeks ago discussing Progressive Web Apps and responsive design, when someone made the comment "Yeah, but all Bootstrap sites look the same! We started using (insert favorite web framework) instead."  
					</p>
					<p>
							No doubt most modern websites do look the same, but I don't blame Twitter's Bootstrap as much as I blame unimaginitive web developers.  Bootstrap has made it very easy to create clean looking web components like buttons and navigation menus with little effort.  This is great for doing exactly what it says: bootstrapping a website from scratch.  The problem is that most sites never get beyond this initial "bootstapped" phase. 
					 </p> 
					 <p>
							Lazy programers aren't the main culprit, though.  The primary reason we see so many sparse website designs is pragmatic: <i>they work great on small devices</i>.  With 80% of web traffic driven through small mobile devices, it's no wonder that we've focused on sparse designs to the exclusion of bigger, more cluttered, and thus slower websites.
					 </p>
					
					<h5><strong>Gamification<br></strong></h5>
					<p>
						While this sparse approach makes a lot of sense for devices moving over slow networks, the paradigms are once again changing.  Mobile networks and mobile devices are getting faster.  Phones are also getting bigger, and as tablets become more powerful we are seeing a shift toward tablet devices replacing traditional laptops.  And what about that remaining 20% who still access your site through their desktops and laptops? 	
					</p>
					<p>
							Using "heavier" elements that make your website more friendly to users of larger and more powerful displays will be the key to setting your site apart from the run-of-the-mill, minimally bootstrapped competition in 2018.  Animations, custom graphics, and interactive widgets will provide your customers with a pleasurable experience - and a reason to come back to your site.  This should definitely be a consideration if your site already requires a certain amount of interaction, such as a management console or an option picker.
					</p> 
					<h5><strong>It's Not Either/Or<br></strong></h5>
					<p>
							Thanks to media queries in CSS, we can determine the user's screen size and orientation, then design specifically for that format.  Sparse designs using standard web fonts and small images are still great for most phone-sized devices as they are lightning fast to load and provide an uncluttered user interface.  If the user is on a larger screen, we can usually (not always) assume a faster connection and the sparse elements start to make the site look empty.  This is where we can throw in higher resolution graphics and animations to provide interest and "stickiness".
						</p>
					<p>
							Do you have a strong opinion on this you want to share, or have a website you want to update?  Let me know - drop me a line on social media or send me an email.

		<h2 class="text-center title">On The Virtues of Heroku</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2 col-lg-8" >    

				<h5><strong>On The Hunt For A New Host<br></strong></h5>
				<p>
					In early 2016, I decided to find a new host for my personal projects since my previous hosting provider was becoming increasingly limited in the new technologies it could support.  As I looked through my various cloud hosting options, Heroku was looking more and more like the clear choice for hosting personal projects.  When I told my fellow architect buddies that I was seriously considering Heroku, they were indignant.  Why would I waste my time on such a limited hosting provider when Amazon’s AWS platform was clearly a superior architecture.  So I listened to them and set up a free AWS account.  
				</p>   
				
				<h5><strong>The Wisdom of Architects?<br></strong></h5>
				<p>
					Now, I have nothing against AWS but the purpose of my website was to explore new Internet development technologies, not galactic scale cloud infrastructures.  I found myself spending more time on SSH and distribution pipelines, and less time writing interesting applications.  So I quietly went back to my stagnant Heroku account.  After putting a couple applications up there in the course of a few short weeks, I went back to my white-bearded architecture compadres and showed them my Heroku hosted apps.  Of course, when I asked what kind of apps they had hosted on AWS, their response was that they were still working out the details.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course they were.
 				</p> 
				
				<h5><strong>Scale Appropriately<br></strong></h5>
				<p>Now, I have nothing against AWS.  I think its an awesome platform - in fact, Heroku runs on it behind the scenes.  But here’s the thing – I am not interested in setting up a datacenter environment.  I am not looking to build my own Linux distro farm and manage a Superbowl Ad campaign site*.
				</p>
				<p>Heroku has options to scale if you need it to, but it doesn’t come out of the box that way.  The beauty of Heroku is that it is a progressive environment.  It starts with a dead-simple deployment pipeline, and then scales to a multi-dyno environment based on the super powered AWS platform. 
				</p>

				<p>
				*Which I have done – and my client sooo wished they had chosen AWS when the wreckage of that failed hosting environment settled
 				</p>  
				<h5><strong>Build Only What You Need<br></strong></h5>
				<p>
					One of the keys to agile development is that you build only what you need.  Your app likely doesn’t need to scale from day one, but it may eventually.  Heroku has an easy to use progressive dyno setup, so I am able to write a ton of proof of concept apps, and I can choose to scale the successful ones when the time is right.

				<h2 class="text-center title">Happy To Be Here!</h2>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2 col-lg-8" >    
				<p>As the first article on this page, there is some decorum that must be followed. Namely: thanking you for reading, introducing myself, and giving an overview of the intent of this writing space. </p>  
				<p>	Let’s get right down to it…
				</p>
				<h5><strong>Thank You For Reading!<br></strong></h5>
				<p>Of all the techie consultant sites on the Internet, you are reading mine  - so thank you for your time.  I hope you can find something valuable here.  If there is a specific technical topic that you would like me to cover, or cover again in more detail, drop me a line and I will be happy to oblige.</p>   
								<h5><strong>A Brief Introduction<br></strong></h5>
				<p>My name is Anton (aka Tony) Cagle, and I have been a software architect and developer since the very dawn of the 21st century.  I actually got my first technical gig as a day trader data analyst/developer in January of 2000.  Since then I have provided services for several companies across the US Midwest, performing database administration, service development, api design, application development, network design, and enterprise strategy.  I hold certifications from Microsoft, Oracle (Sun), ITIL, and SAFe (Agile), and am a trained Software Architect through Carnegie Mellon University.  
				</p>
				<p>
				In addition to development, I also do a good amount of professional writing.  Over the years, I have written dozens of developer training articles, over 100 emerging technology reviews, and countless corporate strategy papers.  I have also contributed chapters concerning the history of philosophy to a major Australian business philosophy book.
				</p>  
												<h5><strong>The Purpose of This Site<br></strong></h5>
				<p>While I write (mostly pseudonymously) on other non-technical topics, this space is dedicated to topics that are of particular interest to developers and clients of emerging web technologies.  The internet is in a new phase; techniques and models we learned 5 years ago are quickly becoming outmoded. Web development is more complex than ever, and now accounts for IoT, bots, full cloud solutions, and deep learning.  With this site I hope to provide an overview of some of my own projects that explore this space, as well as provide some seasoned advice from a battle-tested development consultant.
