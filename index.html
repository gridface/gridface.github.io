				<h5><strong>On The Hunt For A New Host<br></strong></h5>
				<p>
					In early 2016, I decided to find a new host for my personal projects since my previous hosting provider was becoming increasingly limited in the new technologies it could support.  As I looked through my various cloud hosting options, Heroku was looking more and more like the clear choice for hosting personal projects.  When I told my fellow architect buddies that I was seriously considering Heroku, they were indignant.  Why would I waste my time on such a limited hosting provider when Amazon’s AWS platform was clearly a superior architecture.  So I listened to them and set up a free AWS account.  
				</p>   
				
				<h5><strong>The Wisdom of Architects?<br></strong></h5>
				<p>
					Now, I have nothing against AWS but the purpose of my website was to explore new Internet development technologies, not galactic scale cloud infrastructures.  I found myself spending more time on SSH and distribution pipelines, and less time writing interesting applications.  So I quietly went back to my stagnant Heroku account.  After putting a couple applications up there in the course of a few short weeks, I went back to my white-bearded architecture compadres and showed them my Heroku hosted apps.  Of course, when I asked what kind of apps they had hosted on AWS, their response was that they were still working out the details.
				</p>
				<p>
					Of course they were.
 				</p> 
				
				<h5><strong>Scale Appropriately<br></strong></h5>
				<p>Now, I have nothing against AWS.  I think its an awesome platform - in fact, Heroku runs on it behind the scenes.  But here’s the thing – I am not interested in setting up a datacenter environment.  I am not looking to build my own Linux distro farm and manage a Superbowl Ad campaign site*.
				</p>
				<p>Heroku has options to scale if you need it to, but it doesn’t come out of the box that way.  The beauty of Heroku is that it is a progressive environment.  It starts with a dead-simple deployment pipeline, and then scales to a multi-dyno environment based on the super powered AWS platform. 
				</p>

				<p>
				*Which I have done – and my client sooo wished they had chosen AWS when the wreckage of that failed hosting environment settled
 				</p>  
				<h5><strong>Build Only What You Need<br></strong></h5>
				<p>
					One of the keys to agile development is that you build only what you need.  Your app likely doesn’t need to scale from day one, but it may eventually.  Heroku has an easy to use progressive dyno setup, so I am able to write a ton of proof of concept apps, and I can choose to scale the successful ones when the time is right.

				<p>As the first article on this page, there is some decorum that must be followed. Namely: thanking you for reading, introducing myself, and giving an overview of the intent of this writing space. </p>  
				<p>	Let’s get right down to it…
				</p>
				<h5><strong>Thank You For Reading!<br></strong></h5>
				<p>Of all the techie consultant sites on the Internet, you are reading mine  - so thank you for your time.  I hope you can find something valuable here.  If there is a specific technical topic that you would like me to cover, or cover again in more detail, drop me a line and I will be happy to oblige.</p>   
								<h5><strong>A Brief Introduction<br></strong></h5>
				<p>My name is Anton (aka Tony) Cagle, and I have been a software architect and developer since the very dawn of the 21st century.  I actually got my first technical gig as a day trader data analyst/developer in January of 2000.  Since then I have provided services for several companies across the US Midwest, performing database administration, service development, api design, application development, network design, and enterprise strategy.  I hold certifications from Microsoft, Oracle (Sun), ITIL, and SAFe (Agile), and am a trained Software Architect through Carnegie Mellon University.  
				</p>
				<p>
				In addition to development, I also do a good amount of professional writing.  Over the years, I have written dozens of developer training articles, over 100 emerging technology reviews, and countless corporate strategy papers.  I have also contributed chapters concerning the history of philosophy to a major Australian business philosophy book.
				</p>  
												<h5><strong>The Purpose of This Site<br></strong></h5>
				<p>While I write (mostly pseudonymously) on other non-technical topics, this space is dedicated to topics that are of particular interest to developers and clients of emerging web technologies.  The internet is in a new phase; techniques and models we learned 5 years ago are quickly becoming outmoded. Web development is more complex than ever, and now accounts for IoT, bots, full cloud solutions, and deep learning.  With this site I hope to provide an overview of some of my own projects that explore this space, as well as provide some seasoned advice from a battle-tested development consultant.
